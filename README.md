**What is AIfluencers OTO and Its Front-End Offer?**

AIfluencers OTO is a revolutionary platform that allows anyone to create customized virtual influencers powered by artificial intelligence.

These AI-driven digital personalities can produce social media content, engage with audiences, promote products, and help you establish an influencer presence without the costs of hiring real people.

With AIfluencers, you can:

Build lifelike virtual influencers tailored to your niche in minutes

Deploy them on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook to attract followers

Monetize through sponsored posts, affiliate marketing, chatbots, and more

It’s an ideal tool for marketers, agencies, ecommerce brands, and anyone looking to capitalize on the booming influencer marketing industry.



AIfluencers makes influencer marketing accessible even for complete beginners. No fancy tech skills needed!



The front-end offer is called AIfluencers Commercial.



It’s priced at $37 and includes core features like:

Create up to 100 AI influencers

Generate 500 images per influencer

Create 100 videos per influencer

Add custom poses, faces, outfits, voices, etc.

Publish content directly to top social media platforms

Embed influencers on websites

Monetize through multiple income streams

Track performance analytics

Commercial license to profit from influencers

Plus more!

This front-end version offers tremendous value, allowing you to get started with virtual influencer marketing right away.



But AIfluencers also provides additional OTOs that unlock more advanced capabilities.

Let’s look at what’s available.

**How Many OTOs Does AIfluencers Have?**

AIfluencers offers 4 OTOs after the front-end purchase:

OTO 1: Unlimited Upgrade

OTO 2: Professional Upgrade

OTO 3: Enterprise Upgrade

OTO 4: Monetizer Upgrade

Additionally, there are 2 special bundled offers:

FastPass: Includes all OTOs except the front-end

MegaBundle Add-On: Extra features for Bundle buyers

So in total, you have:

1 Main Offer (Front-End)

4 OTO Upgrades

1 FastPass Bundle

1 MegaBundle Add-On

Let’s break these down in more detail.

**AIfluencers FastPass**

The AIfluencers FastPass is a special offer that bundles all of the OTOs together (except the front-end) at a discounted price.

Price: $247

Includes: OTOs 1-4

Discount: Saves over 35% compared to buying individually

The FastPass allows you to get all the advanced upgrades in one convenient package. But it does not include the core front-end software.



This means to buy the FastPass, you’ll first need to purchase the front-end separately at $37.

Then you can grab the FastPass to unlock all additional features for just $247.



Buying this way saves time and money compared to purchasing each OTO individually after the front-end.



So the FastPass is ideal if you want all the capabilities AIfluencers offers.



Next, let’s look at another bundled offer: the MegaBundle Add-On.

**AIfluencers MegaBundle Add-On**

The MegaBundle Add-On is an optional upgrade exclusively for AIfluencers + FastPass buyers.

Here are key details on the MegaBundle Add-On:

Price: $197

For: AIfluencers + FastPass buyers

Includes: Extra templates, assets, integrations, and more

So if you purchase the AIfluencers + FastPass (front-end + OTOs 1-4), you can further upgrade with the MegaBundle Add-On for just $197.



This add-on takes your AIfluencers toolkit to the next level.



Now let’s dive into what each individual OTO offers.

**Who’s Behind The Creation?**

The man who creates this software is Abhi Dwivedi. He is a big and established Jvzoo software vendor, and he is located in Abu Dhabi. He doesn’t sell product in one specific category, in fact, I see that he sells products ranging in multiple categories. He is the owner of AiDuals, AIOffices, EmailExpert AI and many more,…



About the quantity, well, I see he will launch new product in monthly basis, so, AIFluencers is the first and the only in November 2024. And I see that he seems focusing on quantity of launches over qualities of launch. But at least, I see that Abhi Dwivedi never plays a trick as some other rubbish Jvzoo, Warrior Plus vendors are doing (like re-launch a product by changing software name, logo and domain or retiring a software by cancelling hosting & domain subscription just after 1, 2 years successfully selling it)
